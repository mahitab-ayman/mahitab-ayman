<p>
  👋 I'm a junior Computer Science student at Nile University, Egypt, with expertise in AI, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), IoT, and Flutter. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer for AI Training Data at Outlier AI (in collaboration with G2I), where I evaluate AI-generated code, solve complex coding challenges, and contribute to the development of advanced AI models.

I have experience as a Junior Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, and intern at Samsung Innovation Campus, with proficiency in Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and Node.js. Passionate about learning and innovation, I have participated in and won various hackathons and competitions.
